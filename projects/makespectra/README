added option to set the grb integration duration, ignoring the duration settings in the input file.
Motivations: to integrate TGF cumulative spectra over a larget time interval.
Removes from bkg calucation any grb time interval superposition.

modified input file format, see ChangeLog for details

aim: make VSB/TGF cumulative spectra suitable for analysis with xspec

Reads a text file formatted with these columns:
	int runid;
	int trg;
	float counts;
	float cpeak;
	int subms;
	float hr;
	float lon;
	float lat;
	float dt;
	double t0;
	float t90;
	float dt0;	// time difference of the found trigger with respect to the initial t0 (bstart)
	float tgrbini;

The first row contains only the number of following rows (int) to be processed.
For each subsequent row, it opens the archival 3908 rootfile and cumulates spectra.
In the end the source and background pha files compliant with xspec specifications are saved.
