+ 03/06/10 set pdhuformat=kTRUE also if INSTRUME==GRID. needed to work on DAFNE simulations by Pavia INFN team
+ 21/05/10 commented out SaveToFile() methods for analysis routine: save only RT and H files
+ 21/09/09 modified check on previous trigger time in process3908.cpp (very important: otherwise some triggers are neglected): != rather than > tpr
+ 08/04/09 note: cannot comment out analysis routines easily, at least SciRM are needed
+ 29/01/09 process3908(): now works even if the BOOST file is not found; in this case prints 'UNK' label
+ 29/10/08 process3908(): reads also MCAL16MS and MCAL1MS flags for the "missing pre-burst" issue debugging
           added these info to output file (processing tools to be modified accordingly).

21 August 2008
TAG CVS: V_1_1_6
+ 21/08/08 corrected for time generation in tmp_grb file (mcal-grb.dat file online)
+ 16/06/08 process3908(): modified data types for keywords BSCIRTMT and BKGERTMT for sub-ms trigger management
+ 20/03/08 process3908(): corrected bug to avoid fake triggers with online pipeline: included UNK label
