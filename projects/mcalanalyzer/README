Project: mcalanalizer
Program for conversion of lv1 files to ROOT format, construction of basic histograms,
application of default analysis routines and basic diagnostic.

Usage: mcalanalizer <lv1_file>
or
mcalanalizer <H_file>
where <lv1_file> is a level1 fits file and <H_file> is the histogram file stored in $MCALSW/bin/mcalsw_output/H.
If applied on a <H_file>, no conversion is performed and only analysis routines are applied to already
produced histograms.
